Iris Flower Classification

This project involves the classification of Iris flower species using the popular Iris dataset. 
The steps include data loading, exploration, visualization, preprocessing, model training using Logistic Regression, and evaluation of the model's performance through accuracy, classification report, and confusion matrix.
The project demonstrates the end-to-end workflow of a typical machine learning task, from data preparation to model validation.

Sales Prediction Model

This project focuses on predicting sales based on advertising expenditures across three different media channels: TV, Radio, and Newspaper. The goal is to develop a machine learning model that accurately forecasts sales and helps businesses optimize their advertising strategies.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains the following columns:
•	TV: Advertising expenditure in TV (in thousands of dollars)
•	Radio: Advertising expenditure in Radio (in thousands of dollars)
•	Newspaper: Advertising expenditure in Newspaper (in thousands of dollars)
•	Sales: Sales of the product (in thousands of units)

Project Steps
1. Data Preprocessing
•	Import Libraries: Import necessary libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit-learn.
•	Load Dataset: Load the dataset into a pandas DataFrame.
•	Check for Missing Values: Ensure there are no missing values in the dataset.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
•	Data Visualization: Use seaborn and matplotlib to create visualizations that help understand the distribution of data and relationships between variables.
•	Correlation Analysis: Analyze correlations between advertising expenditures and sales.
3. Data Preprocessing
•	Feature Scaling: Standardize the features to ensure they contribute equally to the model.
4. Model Building
•	Train-Test Split: Split the data into training and testing sets.
•	Linear Regression Model: Use Linear Regression to model the relationship between advertising expenditures and sales.
5. Model Evaluation
•	Grid Search: Perform Grid Search to find the best hyperparameters for the Linear Regression model.
•	Evaluation Metrics: Evaluate the model using Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R² Score.

Results
•	The model showed a good fit, with low MSE and MAE values, and a high R² Score indicating that a significant portion of the variance in sales can be explained by the advertising expenditures.
•	TV and Radio expenditures have a stronger correlation with sales compared to Newspaper expenditure.

Conclusion
The sales prediction model developed in this project effectively forecasts sales based on advertising expenditures across TV, Radio, and Newspaper channels. The results demonstrate that TV and Radio have a more significant impact on sales. This model can be a valuable tool for businesses to optimize their advertising budgets and maximize their sales.
Further improvements can be made by exploring more complex models, incorporating additional features, and fine-tuning hyperparameters to enhance the model's accuracy.
