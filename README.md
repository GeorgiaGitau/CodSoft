**Iris Flower Classification**

This project demonstrates the application of machine learning techniques to classify different species of Iris flowers based on their features. Using a well-known dataset and a logistic regression model, we aim to accurately predict the species of an Iris flower given its measurements.

Project Overview
In this Jupyter Notebook, we will explore the Iris dataset, perform data preprocessing, and build a logistic regression model to classify Iris flowers into three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. We will also evaluate the model's performance using various metrics.

Dataset Description
The Iris dataset consists of 150 samples from each of three species of Iris flowers (Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica). Four features were measured from each sample:
•	Sepal Length: Length of the sepal in centimeters.
•	Sepal Width: Width of the sepal in centimeters.
•	Petal Length: Length of the petal in centimeters.
•	Petal Width: Width of the petal in centimeters.

The goal is to predict the species of an Iris flower based on these features.
Steps Involved
1.	Data Loading: Load the Iris dataset using pandas.
2.	Data Exploration: Explore the dataset to understand its structure and visualize the relationships between features using seaborn and matplotlib.
3.	Data Preprocessing: Standardize the features to ensure they have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.
4.	Model Building: Build a logistic regression model using scikit-learn.
5.	Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.
6.	Visualization: Visualize the model's predictions and the confusion matrix.

Results
•	Accuracy: The logistic regression model achieved high accuracy on both training and validation sets.
•	Confusion Matrix: The confusion matrix revealed that the model made very few misclassifications, further confirming its effectiveness.
•	Feature Importance: Petal length and petal width were identified as the most significant features for distinguishing between the different Iris species.

Conclusion
The Iris Flower Classification project successfully demonstrates the use of logistic regression for a multi-class classification problem. The model achieved high accuracy and provided insights into the relationships between different features of Iris flowers. This project serves as a valuable learning experience for applying machine learning techniques to solve real-world classification problems.



**Sales Prediction Model**

This project focuses on predicting sales based on advertising expenditures across three different media channels: TV, Radio, and Newspaper. The goal is to develop a machine learning model that accurately forecasts sales and helps businesses optimize their advertising strategies.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains the following columns:
•	TV: Advertising expenditure in TV (in thousands of dollars)
•	Radio: Advertising expenditure in Radio (in thousands of dollars)
•	Newspaper: Advertising expenditure in Newspaper (in thousands of dollars)
•	Sales: Sales of the product (in thousands of units)

Project Steps
1. Data Preprocessing
•	Import Libraries: Import necessary libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit-learn.
•	Load Dataset: Load the dataset into a pandas DataFrame.
•	Check for Missing Values: Ensure there are no missing values in the dataset.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
•	Data Visualization: Use seaborn and matplotlib to create visualizations that help understand the distribution of data and relationships between variables.
•	Correlation Analysis: Analyze correlations between advertising expenditures and sales.
3. Data Preprocessing
•	Feature Scaling: Standardize the features to ensure they contribute equally to the model.
4. Model Building
•	Train-Test Split: Split the data into training and testing sets.
•	Linear Regression Model: Use Linear Regression to model the relationship between advertising expenditures and sales.
5. Model Evaluation
•	Grid Search: Perform Grid Search to find the best hyperparameters for the Linear Regression model.
•	Evaluation Metrics: Evaluate the model using Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R² Score.

Results
•	The model showed a good fit, with low MSE and MAE values, and a high R² Score indicating that a significant portion of the variance in sales can be explained by the advertising expenditures.
•	TV and Radio expenditures have a stronger correlation with sales compared to Newspaper expenditure.

Conclusion
The sales prediction model developed in this project effectively forecasts sales based on advertising expenditures across TV, Radio, and Newspaper channels. The results demonstrate that TV and Radio have a more significant impact on sales. This model can be a valuable tool for businesses to optimize their advertising budgets and maximize their sales.
Further improvements can be made by exploring more complex models, incorporating additional features, and fine-tuning hyperparameters to enhance the model's accuracy.
